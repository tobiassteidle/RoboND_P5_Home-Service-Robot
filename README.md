Final Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree Project "Home Service Robot"

### Used Packages

[gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping)  
With the gmapping_demo.launch file, you can easily perform SLAM and build a map of the environment with a robot equipped with laser range finder sensors or RGB-D cameras.

[turtlebot_teleop](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop)  
With the keyboard_teleop.launch file, you can manually control a robot using keyboard commands.

[turtlebot_rviz_launchers](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_rviz_launchers)  
With the view_navigation.launch file, you can load a preconfigured rviz workspace. You’ll save a lot of time by launching this file, because it will automatically load the robot model, trajectories, and map for you.

[turtlebot_gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo)  
With the turtlebot_world.launch you can deploy a turtlebot in a gazebo environment by linking the world file to it.
